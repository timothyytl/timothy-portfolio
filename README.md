<p>
  This is my portfolio website created to provide an appealing platform online apart from a standard boring resume or CV to elaborate a bit more on myself and to showcase my work and projects to potential employers and/or collaborators in the tech sector. 
</p>
<p>
  If you're on my repo viewing this README and my portfolio website right now, I'd like to thank you for your time and kind interest in me and skills and work experiences. If, however, my current skills and experiences do not match what you are looking for at the moment, feel free to keep me in your list of potential candidates for future consideration because I'm always growing and improving as an individual and a programmer so you can count on an improved version of 'me' ðŸ˜Ž in the near future!  
</p>
<p>
  Cheers and have a wonderful day ahead! ðŸ˜Š
