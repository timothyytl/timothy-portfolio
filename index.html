        <h3>As a Developer</h3>
        <p>
          The pandemic lockdown back in 2020 has led me to discover the world of
          coding. Being a self-driven individual, I was constantly searching for
          ideas and ways to make the most out of my time being at home and so I
          decided to try my hands at coding and of course being unsure of where
          to start, I got myself dipping my toe in the water by first
          self-learning Python online as my first introductory experience into
          the programming world.
          <br />
          <br />
          When I came across a local coding bootcamp and enrolled on their
          online program on a part-time basis, I was introduced to the world of
          software development and Javascript and thus fast-forward today, I've
          learnt to build a wide range of projects and software applications,
          gradually honing my coding skills and understanding along the way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Why coding fascinates me? - Because I've always been a builder at
          heart. I am extremely passionate about building things from houses to
          woodwork, miniature models, 3d printing, handicrafts, to Lego, and so
          on. Hence having discovered the resemblance between building physical
          objects with digital products, in addition to the hours invested on
          learning code everyday, I've made a firm decision to take on this path
          as my career moving forward.
